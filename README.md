# Book-TL-Scraper
This project is designed to scrape chapters from a specific book at the following link: [https://www.deqixs.com/xiaoshuo/11/]. To use this program, the inputted link must be a link of a specifc chapter, eg. "https://www.deqixs.com/xiaoshuo/11/7837.html".

The current functionality allows you to save the contents of a chapter and all after it, which can then be translated using various tools. 

## Future Plans
With additional resources, future versions of this project could leverage local AI models or cloud-based AI APIs to automate both the content collection and translation process. This would significantly speed up the translation workflow and improve the overall user experience.
